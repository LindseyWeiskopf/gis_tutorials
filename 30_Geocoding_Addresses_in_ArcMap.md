# Geocoding Address Data in ArcMap

*This tutorial will guide you through the process of geocoding address data in ArcMap 10.6.1*

The data for this tutorial is [Day Care Centers](https://github.com/alisaalias/gis_tutorials/blob/alisaalias-patch-1/data/Tutorial_30_Data.xlsx) in New York City. The data have been cleaned (e.g. the column headers have been adjusted to remove spaces and redundant columns have been removed). However, there is still some work to do in Excel before the data can be geocoded in ArcMap. This is often the case with datasets that contain address data and no other location information. Addresses are often contained within one column and delimited with a variety of separators (e.g. comma, tab, space, etc.).
